This is an exercise to peer into git's internals.

## Implemented Commands

- cat-file
- commit-tree
- commit
- hash-object
- init
- ls-files
- ls-tree
- write-tree

I've added tests for `add`, but I think writing to the index file may be something I leave out of scope. I don't think it'll help me understand the internals much better, and it will be very tedious.
